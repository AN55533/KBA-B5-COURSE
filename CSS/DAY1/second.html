    <p class="box">Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public digital ledger that records transactions across a network
    of computers. It's a secure and transparent way to track and verify data, eliminating the need for a central authority.
    Each "block" in the chain contains a set of transactions, and blocks are linked chronologically, making it difficult to
    alter any record without altering all subsequent blocks.
    Here's a more detailed explanation:
    Decentralized and Distributed:
    Blockchain doesn't rely on a single entity to manage the ledger; instead, it's distributed across a network of
    computers.
    Immutable:
    Once a transaction is recorded in a block, it's extremely difficult to change or delete it without the agreement of the
    entire network.
    Transparent:
    While often public, blockchains can also be private or consortium-based, with access restricted to specific
    participants.
    Cryptographic Security:
    Blockchain uses cryptography to secure transactions and verify the integrity of the data.
    Consensus Mechanisms:
    Blockchain networks use consensus mechanisms (like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake) to ensure that all network
    participants agree on the validity of transactions and the order of blocks.
    Smart Contracts:
    Some blockchain platforms allow for the execution of self-executing agreements known as "smart contracts".
